# Credits!

Hi! Your probably reading this to find out how I made this. Well, It was not only me I had help from {¬ßean} {D√òmenick}. 


# My Contribution

Well to start I am making this [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) from scratch! The way I've contributed is in the "Pure Code" Basically a simple way to say Im the coder. Now to break that down: I made the Website ("Hidden Parts" or the "Backstage") So that means i put everything together.

# ¬ßean

Now for a simple way to put this, ¬ßean made the **Earth Model** using **Unity** and an extention to Build the game (whilst not making code from scratch).

# D√òmenick

Now D√òmenick did the research, but to set that aside he was the moral support. üëç
